# Cafe-Analytics-Report
This repository contains my MSc assignment, "Café On The Sea: Analytics Report," for the "Data Driven Decisions for Business" module. It provides strategic recommendations on café expansion, product performance, and delivery impact, using data from Blackpool, Portsmouth, and Southampton with a focus on quality, preparation, and visualization.
