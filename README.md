# Cafe-Analytics-Report

This repository contains my MSc Management with Data Analytics assignment for the module "Data Driven Decisions for Business" at BPP University. The project, titled "Café On The Sea: Analytics Report," involves a comprehensive analysis aimed at providing strategic recommendations for the expansion and optimization of Café on The Sea's business operations.

Project Overview
The report addresses key business questions such as identifying the most profitable location for expansion, determining underperforming products, and assessing the impact of a home delivery service on sales performance. Using data from three different café locations—Blackpool, Portsmouth, and Southampton—the analysis focuses on data quality issues, data preparation, and thorough data visualization to provide actionable insights.
